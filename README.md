HTML, CSS, JavaScript - Skills Assessment

I've changed the selection menu's location to the top as it is more functional there and also prevents issues with scrolling ;)

Please also note that none of the JavaScript or CSS is from any framework, I hand-coded it myself for this test.
The shapes in the GUI are glyph icons; please note that they are not from "GlyphIcons", and not all the icons in such a set, but only the 3 needed for this assessment.  Please open the font files in a font viewer to assert that this is true.

Please also check that when you disable JavaScript it will notify you that it is required.
When you resize the window to smaller than a speciphic resolution, the GUI will merge with the sides of the window, no longer having  rounded corners, or margins, which works well for both mobile and desktop (HD) displays.
Please note that the font size also changes, it is a "fluid" design, so drag the window size to your hearts desire and see how the font size changes and the gui updates accordingly - and this is done in pure CSS.

Much of the contacts functionality can be replaced with CSS and server-side logic, but it would take more time trying to force browser compatibility in doing so, and, using JavaScript can make things a lot simpler; alas, server-side logic was not in the scope of the assessment ans it clearly states: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Please also note that I use CSS classes mostly and not inline css in either HTML or JavaScript.

Thanks for your time and I look forward to working with you!
